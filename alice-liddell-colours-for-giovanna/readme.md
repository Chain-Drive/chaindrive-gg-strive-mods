## Version

`1.2`

## Description

Colours based on Alice Liddell and Chesire Cat from Alice Madness Returns. At 50% tension, Rei (Chesire Cat) will change into the Ash form from the Alice: Asylum concept art. At 100% Tension, Giovanna will go into Hysteria mode. 

The colours are available for slots 2-11. Additionally, I've created a sound mod that plays the Hysteria mode scream when reaching 100% tension. NOTE: this sound effect is replaced globally, and will affect every colour.
